# NASA Battery Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes the NASA Battery Dataset, which includes charge/discharge and impedance measurements of Li-ion batteries over multiple cycles at various temperatures. The dataset provides insights into battery aging and internal parameters such as impedance, electrolyte resistance (`Re`), and charge transfer resistance (`Rct`). The analysis is done using `Plotly` to visualize the changes in these parameters over the battery cycles.

## Prerequisites

Before running this code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly
- tqdm

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy plotly tqdm
